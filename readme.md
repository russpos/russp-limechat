# My LimeChat theme.

### How to install.

1. Clone the repo in `/Users/yourname/Library/Application Support/LimeChat/Themes`

2. Run `make.sh` to generate `Russ.js`

3. Make symlinks to the JS, CSS, and YAML files in your themes directory.  It should look like this when you are done

```
/Users/russp/Library/Application Support/LimeChat/Themes/Russ.css => Russ/Russ.css
/Users/russp/Library/Application Support/LimeChat/Themes/Russ.yaml => Russ/Russ.yaml
/Users/russp/Library/Application Support/LimeChat/Themes/Russ.js => Russ/Russ.js
